# VideoSkip-extension

This is a development fork for experimentation with new features. None of these are working yet, but ideas include:
- *In-app list* of available skip files with links to start playing each video.
- *Custom categories:* let the skip file author specify any categories to filter and display those in the UI 
- *Scene re-ordering:* I have heard that if Memento is watched in chronological order it is a completely different experience.
- *Steadycam:* A shaky camera adds drama to a scene, but can we do something to reduce it for those who get motion sickness?

This fork will strive to keep skip file format compatibility with the official version.

VideoSkip has the ability to filter out objectionable content from streaming services. It can skip sections entirely, or simply mute the sound or blank the video, at user's discretion. Users can exchange video-specific filter settings via .skp text files formatted similarly to .vtt captions. They can also edit those settings right within the app.

VideoSkip does not infringe media copyrights because the video files are not altered in any way. Users choose to see or not to see parts of the content, and the app remembers their choice.
