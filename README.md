# VideoSkip-extension

This is a development fork allowing flexible categories instead of only the Parents Guide categories from IMDB.com used by the official version. Skip files using custom categories will be compatible with the official version and this version will continue to read skip files written by or for the official version.

VideoSkip has the ability to filter out objectionable content from streaming services. It can skip sections entirely, or simply mute the sound or blank the video, at user's discretion. Users can exchange video-specific filter settings via .skp text files formatted similarly to .vtt captions. They can also edit those settings right within the app.

VideoSkip does not infringe media copyrights because the video files are not altered in any way. Users choose to see or not to see parts of the content, and the app remembers their choice.

For the official version:
- Source code: https://github.com/fruiz500/VideoSkip-extension 
- Home page: https://videoskip.org/
- VideoSkip Exchange, where users can get and contribute skip files:  https://videoskip.org/exchange
